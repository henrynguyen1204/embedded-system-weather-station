# ESP8266 Weather Station

## Overview

The ESP8266 Weather Station is a project that allows you to create a real-time weather monitoring system using the ESP8266 NodeMCU and the OpenWeatherMap API. The system fetches weather data for a specified location and displays it on an ST7735 TFT Display.

## Features

- Real-time weather updates.
- User-friendly graphical interface on the TFT Display.
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for accurate weather information.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 NodeMCU Lua CP2102
- TFT ST7735 Display
- [List any additional hardware components]

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Package
- Adafruit-ST7735-Library
- OpenWeatherMap API Key

## Installation
